# Random Colour Generator

## Goal

Design an interface with a `<button>` that when clicked, will randomly create a colour and assign it to the `background-color` of the document's `<body>` element.


## Consider

Remember there are >16M colours available on the standard RGB scale. Each colour consisting of an R, G and B in 256 different shades (0 to 255, in decimal).

Break the challenge down into larger ("macro") steps first. See the file `js/index.js` for extensive notes on this problem and tips to approach getting things started.
